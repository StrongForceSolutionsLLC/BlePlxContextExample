# Why?

A buddy of mine is using the react-native-ble-plx package for his job, and ran into an issue with it and React Navigation.

This repo demonstrates how to use the Plx manager with React Navigation and React Context.

# Installation

Download the repo, and run `yarn`. Then, `yarn ios` or `yarn android`.
